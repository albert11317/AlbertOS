Many people have been asking me for this for a long time now, but after 8 grueling months and many 
setbacks, I am proud to introduce AlbertOS Version 1.0: Deluxe Edition. The Deluxe Edition is a limited 
edition operating system which comes with the classic game “Othello”, also known as “Reversi”. This 
game was created by the award-winning genius Sung Min Choi Hong who is currently attending the 
Illinois Institute of Technology. There are many people who have helped me through this struggle: 
Cormac O’Brien, Mr. Rogers, Ben Stryker and even Wyatt Richter. But the one person whom I have to 
thank the most is Kienan Ahner-McHafee. Kienan, despite the stresses of his everyday life, contributed 
countless hours toward making AlbertOS a reality; with not only his commitment and confidence, but 
also his expertise in the field. Without further ado, and with great privilege, I introduce to you the first 
public release of AlbertOS. Before downloading, please note that AlbertOS requires a screen resolution 
of 1366x768 to operate (the most common resolution on laptops) and the latest version of Java, which 
can be downloaded for free from java.com. Please contact me if you wish to see the original source code 
or have any pressing questions, comments, issues, or concerns. Finally, be certain that your sound works,
sound is very important to the experience. Thank you and enjoy!
