After 8 grueling months and many setbacks, I am proud to introduce AlbertOS Version 1.0: Deluxe Edition. This is a limited edition operating system which comes with the classic game “Reversi”, also known as “Othello”. This game was created by the award-winning genius Sung Min Choi Hong. Of all who have helped me, the one person whom I have to thank the most is Kienan Ahner-McHafee, who contributed countless hours toward making AlbertOS a reality. Before downloading, please note that AlbertOS requires a screen resolution of at least 1366x768 to operate (the most common resolution on laptops) and the latest version of Java, which can be downloaded for free from java.com. Finally, be certain that your sound works, sound is very important to the experience. Thank you and enjoy!
